# -C   Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and
#   data for forwarded X11, TCP and UNIX-domain connections). The compression
#   algorithm is the same used by gzip(1), and the “level” can be controlled by
#   # the CompressionLevel option for protocol version 1. Compression is
#   desirable # on modem lines and other slow connections, but will only slow
#   down things on # fast networks. The default value can be set on a
#   host-by-host basis in the # configuration files; see the Compression
#   option.
#
# -c  cipher_spec Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.
#   Protocol version 1 allows specification of a single cipher. The supported
#   values are “3des”, “blowfish”, and “des”. For protocol version 2,
#   cipher_spec is a comma-separated list of ciphers listed in order of
#   preference. See the Ciphers keyword in ssh_config(5) for more information.
